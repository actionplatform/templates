"""AWS Lambda entry point — adapts the ASGI app from `app.create_app()` with Mangum.

The app is rebuilt per invocation with the lifespan run each time: an MCP
session manager refuses to start twice on one instance, and the rebuild costs
milliseconds. Stateless transports are the app's own concern (see create_app).
